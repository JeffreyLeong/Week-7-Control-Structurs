It is the year 2025 and there are now 8 different booster vaccinations. A person can receive a booster vaccination if they are a teacher, over 65 years old, or they have a medical condition.

Put the vaccinations into an list or another data structure of your choice.  

The vaccinations are "pfizer-alpha", "moderna-alpha", "johnson-alpha", "pfizer-omega", "pfizer-kappa", "moderna-delta", "moderna-gamma", "moderna-zeta"

Write a program to ask a person their name, age, and if they have a medical condition.

Determine if they should get a vaccination. 

If they should get a vaccination, print out their name, age, and all the booster vaccinations using a for-loop or a for-each loop.

If they should not get a booster vaccination, tell them they should not get a booster vaccination and quit the program.
